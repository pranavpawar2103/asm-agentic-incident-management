## Known issues and resolutions

### KB-BIL-001 — Monthly invoice run fails / invoices not generated

**Symptoms**
- Job `INV_MONTHLY_RUN` ends with status `FAILED`; invoices for the period are missing.
- Celery logs: `TaxServiceTimeout: tax API did not respond in 30s`.

**Root cause**
The external tax calculation API throttles requests during month-end peak; the run aborts after repeated timeouts.

**Resolution steps**
1. Check the tax provider status page.
2. Re-run in resume mode: `manage.py invoice_run --period <YYYY-MM> --resume --batch-size 200`.
3. If the tax API is down, enable cached tax rates (`TAX_FALLBACK=cached`) — requires Finance Controller approval.
4. Reconcile: invoice count = shipped orders count for the period (report *Billing → Run summary*).

**Escalation:** P1 during month-end close. Inform the Finance Controller.

### KB-BIL-002 — Invoice shows wrong tax amount

**Symptoms**
- Customer or finance user reports GST/VAT on the invoice is incorrect (0% or old rate).

**Root cause**
Customer tax code missing in the customer master (synced from CRM), or the tax rate table was not updated after a statutory change.

**Resolution steps**
1. Open the invoice and check the tax code applied.
2. If the customer tax code is missing, update the account in CRM and run `CUST_SYNC`.
3. If the rate is outdated, raise a change to update the tax rate table (Finance approval).
4. Cancel the incorrect invoice with a credit note and re-issue.

**Escalation:** P3 single invoice; P2 if the rate table is wrong for all customers.

### KB-BIL-003 — Invoice email bounced / customer did not receive invoice

**Symptoms**
- Delivery report shows `550 5.1.1 recipient address rejected`.
- Customer says invoice never arrived.

**Root cause**
Customer billing email in the customer master is incorrect or the mailbox no longer exists.

**Resolution steps**
1. Check *Billing → Invoice → Delivery log*.
2. Confirm the correct billing email with the account manager.
3. Update the billing contact in CRM, run `CUST_SYNC`, then click *Resend invoice*.

**Escalation:** None. P4.

### KB-BIL-004 — Credit note cannot be created (BIL-CN-403)

**Symptoms**
- Error `BIL-CN-403: approval required — amount above threshold` when creating a credit note.

**Root cause**
Credit notes above **INR 5,00,000** require Finance Controller approval by design. This is expected behaviour, not a defect.

**Resolution steps**
1. Explain the approval policy to the user.
2. User submits the credit note via *Request approval*; the Finance Controller approves in the approvals queue.
3. Once approved, the credit note is created automatically.

**Escalation:** None. P4 (working as designed).

---

### KB-BIL-005 — Customer payment not applied to invoice

**Symptoms**
- Customer has paid but the invoice still shows `OPEN`; dunning reminders sent to the customer.
- Payment sits in *Unapplied cash*.

**Root cause**
The bank remittance reference did not match the invoice number format (e.g. customer used their PO number).

**Resolution steps**
1. Search *Unapplied cash* by amount and date.
2. Manually match the payment to the invoice (*Apply payment*).
3. Pause dunning for the customer for 7 days.
4. Ask the account manager to remind the customer to quote the invoice number.

**Escalation:** None. P3 (P2 if a key account was sent a dunning letter).
