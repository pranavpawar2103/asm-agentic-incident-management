## Known issues and resolutions

### KB-BI-001 — Dashboard error "Data source credentials expired"

**Symptoms**
- Dashboard tiles show "Couldn't load data — data source credentials expired".

**Root cause**
The service account password for the Snowflake gateway connection was rotated (90-day policy) and the gateway was not updated.

**Resolution steps**
1. Reporting admin portal → *Gateways → Snowflake-PROD → Data sources*.
2. Update credentials with the new service account password from vault `bi/snowflake-svc`.
3. Trigger *Refresh now* on affected datasets.

**Escalation:** None. P3 (all dashboards on that gateway affected).

### KB-BI-002 — Daily sales report not refreshed

**Symptoms**
- Daily sales report shows yesterday's (or older) date.
- Airflow DAG `daily_sales_load` failed at task `extract_orderhub`.

**Root cause**
Upstream extract failure — OrderHub read replica unavailable or schema change.

**Resolution steps**
1. Airflow UI → `daily_sales_load` → check the failed task log.
2. If a connection error, confirm the OrderHub replica is up and clear the task to retry.
3. If a schema change, raise to the Data Engineering team.
4. After the DAG succeeds, refresh the dataset and confirm the report date.

**Escalation:** P3. Data Engineering for schema issues.

### KB-BI-003 — User cannot see a report / "You don't have access"

**Symptoms**
- User gets "You don't have access to this report" or sees an empty report (no rows).

**Root cause**
User not in the workspace access group, or row-level security (RLS) role not assigned for their region.

**Resolution steps**
1. Get the report owner's approval (attach to ticket).
2. Add the user to the AD group `BI-<workspace>-Viewers`.
3. For empty reports, assign the RLS role for the user's region.
4. Access applies within 1 hour (group sync).

**Escalation:** None. P4.

### KB-BI-004 — Report numbers differ from the source system

**Symptoms**
- User says revenue/orders in the dashboard do not match OrderHub or BillingEngine.

**Root cause**
Usually not a defect: InsightBI uses UTC day boundaries and loads data nightly (cut-off 02:00 UTC); source systems show local time and real-time data.

**Resolution steps**
1. Ask for the exact report, filter and source-system figure.
2. Compare using the same UTC date range.
3. If it still differs after aligning cut-off, raise to Data Engineering with both figures.
4. Otherwise explain the cut-off and close as *Working as designed*.

**Escalation:** None. P4.

### KB-BI-005 — Scheduled report email subscription not delivered

**Symptoms**
- User did not receive the scheduled report email.

**Root cause**
Subscription owner left the company (subscription disabled) or attachment exceeded 25 MB.

**Resolution steps**
1. Reporting admin portal → *Subscriptions* → check status and owner.
2. Re-create the subscription under the user (or a shared mailbox) if the owner is inactive.
3. If the attachment is too large, switch the subscription to "link" instead of attachment.

**Escalation:** None. P4.
