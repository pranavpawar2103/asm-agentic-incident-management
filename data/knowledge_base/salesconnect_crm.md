## Known issues and resolutions

### KB-CRM-001 — User account locked / cannot log in

**Symptoms**
- Login page shows "Your account has been locked. Contact your administrator."
- Usually after 5 failed login attempts or after a password reset in another system.

**Root cause**
Platform lockout policy (5 attempts, 30-minute lock).

**Resolution steps**
1. Verify the user's identity (employee ID + manager name).
2. Admin console → *Users → <user> → Unlock*.
3. If the user forgot the password, click *Reset password* — reset link is sent to the corporate email.
4. Ask the user to log in via the SSO tile on EmployeePortal going forward.

**Escalation:** None. P4 (single user). P3 if user is on a customer call/deadline.

### KB-CRM-002 — Website leads not syncing into CRM

**Symptoms**
- Marketing reports that leads submitted on the website are not visible in CRM.
- Integration logs: `401 INVALID_SESSION_ID` or `Session expired or invalid`.

**Root cause**
The OAuth refresh token of the integration user expired or was revoked after a password change.

**Resolution steps**
1. Check integration middleware → flow `web-leads-to-crm` → error queue.
2. Re-authorise the connected app using the integration user (credentials in vault `crm/integration`).
3. Replay messages from the error queue (*Retry all*).
4. Confirm the count of leads in CRM matches the form submissions for the period.

**Escalation:** P2 (lost sales leads). Inform Marketing Ops when fixed.

### KB-CRM-003 — Dashboards / reports showing stale data

**Symptoms**
- Sales dashboard "last refreshed" timestamp is more than 24 hours old.
- Numbers do not include today's closed deals.

**Root cause**
Scheduled dashboard refresh failed because the running user was deactivated or hit a row limit.

**Resolution steps**
1. Open the dashboard → *Properties* → check the running user is active.
2. Change the running user to the service account `svc_crm_reports` if needed.
3. Click *Refresh* manually and confirm the timestamp updates.

**Escalation:** None. P4 normally (data is still available in list views).

### KB-CRM-004 — "Insufficient privileges" when editing an opportunity

**Symptoms**
- User can view but not edit opportunities/accounts; error "Insufficient privileges".
- Typically after a role change, transfer, or new joiner setup.

**Root cause**
Permission set `Sales_User_Edit` not assigned after role change.

**Resolution steps**
1. Confirm the user's new role with their manager (approval required — attach to ticket).
2. Admin console → *Users → <user> → Permission set assignments → Add `Sales_User_Edit`*.
3. Ask the user to log out and back in.

**Escalation:** None. P3 (P2 at quarter-end).

### KB-CRM-005 — Support emails not creating cases (email-to-case)

**Symptoms**
- Customers email support@ but no case appears in CRM.
- Support team notices case volume dropped to zero.

**Root cause**
The forwarding rule on the support mailbox was disabled (mailbox migration / policy change), so emails never reach the CRM routing address.

**Resolution steps**
1. Check the shared mailbox forwarding rule to the CRM email-to-case routing address.
2. Re-enable the rule (Exchange admin) — requires Messaging team.
3. Forward the emails received during the outage window to the routing address to create cases.
4. Confirm new cases appear with correct origin = Email.

**Escalation:** P2 (customer cases being missed). Messaging team for mailbox rules.
